# February 2018 - Revision-1

February update of 2018 revision-1 will include all the small updates I have done since the last update.
This update will bring some new functionality to the profile.

Regarding this format of updating. I am trying something new, and will release cycles of my powershell profile in this format.
The following format describes how the profile updates will look,
`month-year-rev[1-99]`

Small releases or quick bugfixing will not be updating with its own revision file.

## Included in this relase
In this release, I have done some changes to the overall codespace. Getting the structure to fit better and so on.
Also, I have added some more modules. Since the SpaceX launch was so successfull I created a data wrapper for their public API. /modules/apis/spacex

When I come across an API I would like to use or test out, I will add it to the APIs folder first, before moving on to creating bigger projects of them.

## Files
I am currently doing the overall restructure of my profile, and will start to take shape during this February 2018. 
Trying my best to get the time to work on it, but time has a tendency to just fly by.

## Suggestions/Contribution
If you have any suggestions, or if you would like to contribute, let me know.
