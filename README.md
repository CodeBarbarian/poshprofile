## Informational
My personal powershell profile. Will include tools and automation that I use daily. 

## Installation
Download this repository and place it in your WindowsPowershell Directory
`C:\users\username\Documents\Windows\Powershell`

Change the settings you want, and run Powershell.

Modules are designed so they can be run separately as well (Most of them). 

## Todo
Will keep adding modules, packages and improve on the overall code. 
Structure overhaul time! - Doing some minor/major restructure of my powershell profile, more changes to come
Will only use approved verbs as well. - Lots of changes
